8% Reflections in AXS redistributed hourly with min hold 100,000 LFG & 3% in marketing. Why AXS? While our development team are working on our first game, we want the community to be able to play some other games first. Having AXS will help you to participate in a highly popular crypto game or trade your AXS and make even more! Once our games are launched, you can use both AXS and LFG to participate - within gameplay environment, there will be no taxes. It's a win-win situation to play/trade on-and-off the BSC blockchain. (Note: we're not affiliated with AXS, for reals)
